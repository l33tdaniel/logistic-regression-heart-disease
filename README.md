To make a new python environment: `python -m venv name` (where 'name' is the name of your virtual environment) <br>
Example is from this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSXIbCZNBw0<br>

To install all modules into your virtual environment: `pip install numpy<2 torch torchvision pandas ipykernel scikit-learn`<br>
